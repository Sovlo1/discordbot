# Discord-bot v1

Hi! This was hastily done as a funny way to learn how to use discordjs and its api, it works fine but I've left it as it is for quite some time and don't feel like updating it, this has been redone using nestjs and necord [here](https://github.com/Sovlo1/discord-bot-necord), while being far from perfect it's still a much better version as it's more readable/maintainable.
